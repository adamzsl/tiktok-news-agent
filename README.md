# Szponciciel — TikTok AI News Agent

## Description

Szponciciel is a multi-agent content pipeline that autonomously fetches real news, generates TikTok-style video scripts (with a configurable fact/satire ratio), evaluates them in a Writer ↔ Critic loop, and publishes the final videos across a pool of TikTok accounts — each with its own persona, voice, and language.

The project is developed as a study project within the PIAT Jira space.

## Goal

Build a fully automated, self-improving TikTok content factory that:

- Discovers and ranks trending news articles
- Generates persona-specific scripts blending factual and satirical content (`true_fake_ratio`)
- Refines scripts iteratively until a quality threshold is met
- Converts approved scripts into TikTok-ready videos (TTS narration + AI footage + captions)
- Publishes to multiple TikTok accounts via Zernio
- Collects performance metrics and feeds them back into the pipeline to optimize future content

                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Metrics Collection (future)       │
│  TikTok API: views, likes, completion   │

│  Feeds back into Writer & Critic tuning │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each account runs its own Writer ↔ Critic loop with its own path config. Video footage is generated once per news story and shared; narration and captions are generated per account.

## Results

| Name | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **PIAT-1 — Project Foundation** | Done | All setup and groundwork tasks before development begins. Includes board configuration, workflow graph, framework research, and agent documentation. |
| **PIAT-2 — News Fetcher Agent** | To Do | Fetches, preprocesses, and tags real news as the pipeline entry point. Uses Tavily as the primary tool; handles deduplication, virality pre-scoring, and output schema normalization. |
| **PIAT-3 — Content Creator Agent** | To Do | Generates a per-account TikTok script parameterized by persona, language, tone, `true_fake_ratio`, and voice. Handles Critic feedback within the refinement loop. |
| **PIAT-4 — Critic Agent** | To Do | Evaluates generated scripts for TikTok catchiness. Defines scoring criteria, exit thresholds, and structured feedback format sent back to the Content Creator. |
| **PIAT-5 — Creator ↔ Critic Loop Orchestration** | To Do | Orchestrates the per-account script generation loop using LangGraph. Assigns `run_id`, stores full path metadata per run, and exits on approval or iteration cap. |
| **PIAT-6 — Narrator & Video Generation** | To Do | Converts approved scripts into TikTok-ready videos. Video footage is generated once per story; TTS narration and captions are generated per account and assembled into one video file each. |
| **PIAT-7 — End-to-End Pipeline Orchestration** | To Do | Wires all agents into a functioning pipeline. Covers error handling, retry logic, observability, configuration management, and integration tests. |
| **PIAT-8 — Output & Distribution** | To Do | Publishes generated videos to the TikTok account pool via Zernio with full path metadata attached, scheduling posts to avoid spam-pattern detection. |
| **PIAT-23 — Metrics Collection & Path Analysis** | To Do | Collects TikTok performance metrics (views, likes, completion rate) per post and joins them on `run_id` to build a priors store for the Adaptive Pipeline. |
| **PIAT-27 — Adaptive Pipeline** | To Do | Extends MVP agents to consume historical performance data from the priors store, biasing script ratios, Critic thresholds, and virality scoring toward what works. |
